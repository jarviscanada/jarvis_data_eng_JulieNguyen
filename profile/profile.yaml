# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a recent graduate from Ryerson University with a Bachelor of Science (Honours) (BSc(Hons)) in Computer Science. During my education, I had the opportunity to study software engineering, database systems, and data mining, solidifying my programming fundamentals and gaining a strong interest in software development. Currently, I am a software developer at Jarvis Consulting Group. At Jarvis, I am developing my skill sets using agile software development practices and working hands-on with applications of new technologies (Docker, REST APIs, Springboot, etc.). I am a strong problem-solver, fast-learner and team player who is excited to face new challenges and contribute to the success of a team as a Data Engineer.
