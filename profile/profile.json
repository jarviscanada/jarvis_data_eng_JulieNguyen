This script is used by the Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration (LCA) team to manage a Linux cluster running on CentOS 7. Variables collected include the host's CPU number, total memory, memory free, disk I/O, CPU MHz and more, which are recorded to a PostgresSQL Docker RDBMS database every minute using a bash script running through crontab.",

This app is designed following the well-known MVC architecture, consisting of a model, controller layer, service layer and data access (DAO) layer. The application uses Java, JUnit, Spring, Docker, HTTP and JSON.",
        "**JDBC App:** Implemented a Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) application, which is used to create a connection to a PostgreSQL database. The application allows for the client to perform predefined operations to the database, such as CRUD (create, read, update, delete). The project uses Java, JDBC, Maven, SQL, Docker and PostgreSQL.",
        "**Grep App:** Implemented a Java Grep App is made to replicate the Linux grep command, searching files in a directory and matching strings to within the files. It implements Maven, Stream APIs, Regex and Lambda and is tested using the main method and JUnit testing. The application is contained in a Docker container."
