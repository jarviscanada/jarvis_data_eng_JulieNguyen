# Julie Nguyen . Jarvis Consulting

I am a recent graduate from Ryerson University with a Bachelor of Science (Honours) (BSc(Hons)) in Computer Science. During my education, I had the opportunity to study software engineering, database systems, and data mining, solidifying my programming fundamentals and gaining a strong interest in software development. Currently, I am a software developer at Jarvis Consulting Group. At Jarvis, I am developing my skill sets using agile software development practices and working hands-on with applications of new technologies (Docker, REST APIs, Springboot, etc.). I am a strong problem-solver, fast-learner and team player who is excited to face new challenges and contribute to the success of a team as a Data Engineer.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JulieNguyen](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JulieNguyen)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JulieNguyen/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a cluster monitoring system that records the hardware and resource usage of each host in a system. This script is used by the Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration (LCA) team to manage a Linux cluster running on CentOS 7. Variables collected include the host's CPU number, total memory, memory free, disk I/O, CPU MHz and more, which are recorded to a PostgresSQL Docker RDBMS database every minute using a bash script running through crontab.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JulieNguyen/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - **Twitter App:** Developed an application that allows a user to post, read and delete Tweets via the official Twitter REST APIs. This app is designed following the well-known MVC architecture, consisting of a model, controller layer, service layer and data access (DAO) layer. The application uses Java, JUnit, Spring, Docker, HTTP and JSON.
  - **JDBC App:** Implemented a Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) application, which is used to create a connection to a PostgreSQL database. The application allows for the client to perform predefined operations to the database, such as CRUD (create, read, update, delete). The project uses Java, JDBC, Maven, SQL, Docker and PostgreSQL.
  - **Grep App:** Implemented a Java Grep App is made to replicate the Linux grep command, searching files in a directory and matching strings to within the files. It implements Maven, Stream APIs, Regex and Lambda and is tested using the main method and JUnit testing. The application is contained in a Docker container.


## Highlighted Projects
**Refridge Grocery List Android App**: Worked in a team to create an Android app using Android Studio, Java and Google Firebase. The features of the app included a scanner to read barcodes of grocery items, a secure authentication system recording usernames and passwords and a vast grocery item Firebase database for users to add, remove and edit items efficiently. Team coordination efforts involved GitHub, daily meetings and charts made for project scheduling.

**CACM Document Retrieval Application**: Created a Java program that finds the most relevant document in a collection of over 3000 documents ([the CACM collection](http://ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/resources/test_collections/cacm/)). Preprocessed queries to filter stop words, stem words and non-alphanumeric values and stored document frequency, term frequency, position and document ID for every term. This information was then used to score the document relevancy for any user query to find the most relevant documents.


## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (2021-present)**: Worked in a team of software developers in an Agile/Scrum work environment. This included daily scrum meetings and the opportunity to be a team lead for one two-week sprint. The team lead role contained responsibilities such as leading daily scrum meetings, helping to improve workflow by providing a clearer vision of the project and removing impediments by discussing areas of improvement. Worked with technologies such as PostgreSQL, Docker, Maven, APIs and Github.
